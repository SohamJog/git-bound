# Proof of Defeat

## A self-learning NFT that trains against you, adapts to your playstyle, and evolves into your ultimate rival.

I'm building Proof-of-Defeat (PoD)—an NFT that learns from your moves and becomes a smarter opponent every time you play. Instead of just being a static collectible, PoD analyzes your playstyle, adapts its strategy, and evolves based on real in-game experience.

At launch, PoD starts with Rock Paper Scissors as a proof of concept. Every match updates its on-chain AI, making it harder to beat over time. Eventually, PoD NFTs will be able to battle each other, proving which one has trained the best.

We’re using Arbitrum Stylus to run Q-learning directly on-chain, keeping training data decentralized and transparent. Future expansions could include turn-based games like Tic Tac Toe, Chess, or even AI-driven NFT battles.

With PoD, your NFT isn’t just a profile picture—it’s an opponent that gets better with every loss.
